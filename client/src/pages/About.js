        This Website if A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of
        transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire
        network of computer systems on the blockchain. Each block in the chain
        contains a number of transactions, and every time a new transaction
        occurs on the blockchain, a record of that transaction is added to every
        participantâ€™s ledger. The decentralised database managed by multiple
        participants is known as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).
